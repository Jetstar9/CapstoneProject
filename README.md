# CapstoneProject


The intended goal of this project is to be able to classify/predict up to 4 emotions (happy, neutral, sad, surprise) on our datasets based on a picture image of a human face, by creating data models trained on a supervised, labelled dataset and extending that to a test set that had no impact on the models we had trained. IE: testing the generalization of our model.
